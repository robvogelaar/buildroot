Subject: [PATCH] v3d/driver/V3DDriver.mk: dont strip libv3ddriver.so

Stripping libraries should happen during packaging, or as part of a
post-processing step when creating the rootfs, not when the binaries
are built (even for release builds).

Fix for QA warnings such as:

  WARNING: broadcom-refsw-15.2-r0 do_package: QA Issue: File '/usr/lib/libv3ddriver.so' from broadcom-refsw was already stripped, this will prevent future debugging! [already-stripped]
